this aint doin nothin just made it for the facts like
ate samosa 
singpore's chocolate
did some lulu rides
beating jay z and all dat
being happy and just livin the real artistic life with intellectualism and coolness
talking to my loves, some socializing 
bought the fucking pass to the 2 parties, danced a fucking lot
getting more attached to the reality as it the best when we celebrate
ate pav bhaji yesterday 
still nigga life is great.
ate garam poha while beating to wazir patar's poem and a sunny vibe reel
uniting with a lot of friends and just banging on my dashboard 
feeling like eating chickan aachar and my punjabi kudis
